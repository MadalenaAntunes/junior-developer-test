The original function from Task 3 was supposed to calculate the total price of something, including tax, but it didn’t check if you gave it all the information it needed. For example, if you only told it the price of an item but didn’t mention the tax rate, it wouldn’t work properly.

To fix it, I made sure the function always asks for both the price of the item and the tax rate by using rules (called "types") in the code that tell it: “The price and the tax rate must both be numbers, and you must give me both every time you use this function.” Now if you don’t give both, the function won’t run—it’s like locking the door until you have both keys.

This way, the function always has everything it needs to work properly!
