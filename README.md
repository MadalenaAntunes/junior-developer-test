## Tasks

### **Part 1: Basic JavaScript and TypeScript**

**Task:** Write a TypeScript function `findMax` that accepts an array of numbers and returns the largest number. If the array is empty, it should return `null`.

- **File:** `Task1.ts`
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Run the TypeScript file
  npx ts-node Task1.ts
  ```

### **Part 2: Simple React Component**

**Task:** Create a React component `Greeting` that:

- Accepts a `name` prop and displays "Hello, [name]!".
- Defaults to "Guest" if no `name` is provided.

- **File:** `Task2.js`
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Start a React project or include the component in an existing project
  npm start
  ```

### **Part 3: Debugging**

**Task:** Fix the `calculateTotalPrice` function to handle missing arguments and work as expected.

- **File:** `Task3.ts`
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Run the TypeScript file
  npx ts-node Task3.ts
  ```

### **Part 4: Problem Solving**

**Task:** Write a function `countDeliveredOrders` that counts the number of orders with `delivered: true`.

- **File:** `Task4.js`
- **How to run:**
  ```bash
  # Run the JavaScript file
  npx ts-node Task4.js
  ```

### **Part 5: Communication Exercise**

**Task:** Explain the solution to one of the tasks in simple terms.

- **Explanation:** Included in the main repository as `Task5.md`.
